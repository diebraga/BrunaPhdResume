        Master’s research.
        <br/>
        Awarded funding by the <strong>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES)</strong>, which is a foundation within the Ministry of Education in Brazil whose central purpose is to coordinate efforts to improve the quality of Brazil’s faculty and staff in higher education through grant programs. In Brazil, CAPES is the body responsible for the evaluation of ‘stricto sensu’ graduate courses; access and dissemination of scientific production; investments in high-level resources in the country and abroad; promotion of international scientific cooperation; and initial and continuing teacher education. Research grants are awarded upon a highly competitive selection process that takes into account many aspects, such as the national evaluation of the university and the course, and the student’s academic performance. Having a research project funded by CAPES brings much prestige and recognition to the study itself, to the student, to the supervisor, and to the university.
